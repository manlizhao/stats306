There are several tools available for data visualization. There are paid services/products offered by companies like [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) that let people generate high quality visualizations from data stored in speadsheets and databases. [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a Javascript library that uses a browser to display high quality, interactive graphics. Spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel, also offer visualization tools.\n\nSince this is a course based on the R language, we will explore the visualization tools provided by the R language and packages. Even if we restrict ourselves to R, we have a few choices. The [R base graphics package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/00Index.html) provides basic plotting tools that may be sufficient for many purposes. We will look at the [ggplot2 package](http://ggplot2.org/) that offers a higher level of abstraction to create graphics. For an interesting comparison between base R graphics and ggplots, see this [blog post](https://flowingdata.com/2016/03/22/comparing-ggplot2-and-r-base-graphics/).\n\nLet us start by looking at the **mpg** data set that has information about city and highway mileages for various cars.
